The park name came from wilderness advocate Robert Marshall, who traveled the North Fork Koyukuk country frequently from 1929 to 1939. Marshall called two peaks, Frigid Crags and Boreal Mountain, the gates from Alaska's central Brooks Range into the far north Arctic. Wind, water, temperature, and glacial and tectonic actions sculpted wildly varied landscapes in this east-west trending part of the Rocky Mountains. Southerly foothills step into waves of mountains rising to elevations of 4,000 feet that culminate in limestone or granite peaks over 7,000 feet in elevation. ",

Located just off Blue Lakes Road, several miles southeast of Carson Pass, the peak is a dramatic crag that is near-vertical--and seemingly even overhanging--on three sides. Even by its easiest route, the peak is an interesting, airy, and occasionally spicy class 4 scramble, a rarity and a real treat amidst the gentle terrain of the Tahoe Sierra. The summit is a decomposing volcanic plug that rises up in stark contrast to the surrounding rolling ridgeline, and is more reminiscent of a desert peak than a typical Sierra mountain. It is a striking sight.",

Located along the southern shore of the island, the volcano is between 300,000 and 600,000 years old and emerged above sea level about 100,000 years ago. It is the second youngest product of the Hawaiian hotspot and the current eruptive center of the Hawaiian Emperor seamount chain. Because it lacks topographic prominence and its activities historically coincided with those of Mauna Loa, Kilauea was once thought to be a satellite of its much larger neighbor. ",

Lava caves like this are formed when a river of lava gradually builds solid walls and a ceiling. When the lava flow stops and the last of it passes downhill, a cave is formed. These caves can be a few feet high and only yards long, or they can stretch for miles with high ceilings. There are several lava tubes you can visit around the island but Nahuku is the most easily accessible and is a fantastic example of a massive lava cave.",
